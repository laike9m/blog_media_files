<p>Hi, I'm laike9m. I do a lot of different things.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on <a href="http://github.com/laike9m">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/laike9m">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2142577/laike9m">Stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>

<p>I didn't really start programming before I became a Junior student. Since then, I've done a lot of different things, most of which are tools for my personal use, but you may find some useful too.  You can take a look at my [projects][PRO] to see some of the major stuff I've worked on, or look at my <a href="http://github.com/laike9m">Github account</a>.</p>

<p>Python is my favourite language, whose simplicity and powerfulness fascinates me. C++ is great, but writing C++ code is of less fun.</p>

<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>

<p>I play many kinds of sports, including basketball, soccer, table-tennis and badminton. I'm a crazy <strong><a href="http://en.clubatleticodemadrid.com/">Atlético Madrid</a></strong> supporter since high school.</p>

<h2 id="otaku-culture">Otaku Culture</h2>

<p>Not sure about how to call these stuff: anime, manga, game etc, anyway <strong><a href="http://ladyluckblues.com/"><code>Otaku</code></a></strong> seems to be the most appropriate word. If you are also interested in it, you should read <a href="/blog/xxx,21">this blog post</a> to learn more about my taste.</p>

<h2 id="novels">Novels</h2>

<p>I love reading <strong>detective novels</strong> and <strong>science fictions</strong>. I used to be the 
president of Tsinghua Student Association of Detective and Mystery.</p>
