<p>I didn't really start programming before I became a Junior student. Since then, I've done a lot of different things, most of which are tools for my personal use, but you may find some useful too.  You can take a look at my <a href="/blog/projects">projects</a> to see some of the major stuff I've worked on, or look at my <a href="http://github.com/laike9m">Github account</a>.</p>

<p>Python is my favourite language, whose simplicity and powerfulness fascinates me. C++ is great, but writing C++ code is of less fun.</p>

<p>Not sure about how to call these stuff: anime, manga, game etc, anyway <strong><a href="http://ladyluckblues.com/"><code>Otaku</code></a></strong> seems to be the most appropriate word. If you are also interested in it, you should read <a href="/blog/xxx,21">this blog post</a> to learn more about my taste.</p>
