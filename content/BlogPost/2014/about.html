<p>I went to <a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/then/">Tsinghua University</a> for a degree in Electronic Engineering.
I'm a graduate student of <a href="http://www.ict.ac.cn/">Institute of Computing Technology</a>.</p>

<p>I didn't really start programming before I became a Junior student. Since then, I've done a lot of different things, most of which are tools for my personal use, but you may find some useful too.  Right now the things
that I'm working on are this blog and CAS open source mirror.</p>

<p>Python is my favourite language, whose simplicity and powerfulness fascinates me. C++ is great, but writing C++ code is of less fun.</p>

<p>You can take a look at my <a href="/blog/projects">projects</a> to see some of the major stuff I've
worked on, or cut to the chase and look at my <a href="http://github.com/laike9m/">Github account</a>.</p>

<p>Not sure about how to call these stuff: anime, manga, game etc, anyway <strong><a href="http://ladyluckblues.com/"><code>Otaku</code></a></strong> seems to be the most appropriate word. If you are also interested in it, you should read <a href="/blog/xxx,21">this blog post</a> to learn more about my taste.</p>
