Programming
-----------

I went to [Tsinghua University][THU] for a degree in Electronic Engineering.
I'm a graduate student of [Institute of Computing Technology][ICT].

I didn't really start programming before I became a Junior student. Since then, I've done a lot of different things, most of which are tools for my personal use, but you may find some useful too.  Right now the things
that I'm working on is [FBT][].

Python is my favourite language, whose simplicity and powerfulness fascinates me. C++ is great, but writing C++ code is of less fun.

You can take a look at my [projects][PRO] to see some of the major stuff I've
worked on, or cut to the chase and look at my [Github account][Github].

Otaku Culture
-------------

Not sure about how to call these stuff: anime, manga, game etc, anyway **[`Otaku`][otaku]** seems to be the most appropriate word. If you are also interested in it, you should read [this blog post][ta] to learn more about my taste.
