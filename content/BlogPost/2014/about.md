Programming
-----------

I didn't really start programming before I became a Junior student. Since then, I've done a lot of different things, most of which are tools for my personal use, but you may find some useful too.  You can take a look at my [projects][PRO] to see some of the major stuff I've worked on, or look at my [Github account][Github].

Python is my favourite language, whose simplicity and powerfulness fascinates me. C++ is great, but writing C++ code is of less fun.

Sports
------

I play many kinds of sports, including basketball, soccer, table-tennis and badminton. I'm a crazy **[Atlético Madrid][ATM]** supporter since high school.

Otaku Culture
-------------

Not sure about how to call these stuff: anime, manga, game etc, anyway **[`Otaku`][otaku]** seems to be the most appropriate word. If you are also interested in it, you should read [this blog post][ta] to learn more about my taste.

I love reading **detective novels** and **science fictions**. I used to be the 
president of Tsinghua Student Association of Detective and Mystery.
